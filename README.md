# Malware-Analysis-with-Machine-Learning
Project aims to predict if a software is malware or not by using system call sequences in different window sizes.

## Basic Usage
* .m files should be opened with MATLAB. 
* Datasets are seperated by window sizes, data_5 has window size as 5 etc. 
* Last columns in datasets are 1 for the malicious software, 0 for not.
* Datasets should be in the same path with the code, if not path of the datasets must be set manually or fixed in the code.
```
data = readtable('PATH OF THE DATASET');
```
* For plotting the result in bar plot, algorithm names must be uniqe for each row.

## Results
Accuracy results of different algorithms and customizations are stored in Results folder in results.csv.
